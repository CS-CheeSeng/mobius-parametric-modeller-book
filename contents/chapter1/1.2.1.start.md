# 'Start' Node

The _source node_ of a flowchart is the first node and is highest in the hierarchy of the flowchart, as it contains explicit values instead of being graph-dependent; in MÃ¶bius Parametric Modeller, this is the 'Start' node.

In the 'Start' node, inputs of known variables may be added; this input information may then be used downstream by successive nodes connected from this.

Double Clicking on the Start node brings you to the Procedure Tab, where you will see the following:

## Flowchart Name and Description

The flowchart name and description may be assigned or modified via the input boxes in the 'Start' node. 

## Parameters

Input parameters that are known or determined by the user, which may then be referenced throughout the flowchart. 

There are seven types of parameters:

* Constant
  * _Value_ - Value to be set as default value. Accepts expressions containing strings, numbers and mathematical operators. This value cannot be edited in the dashboard.

* Simple input
  * _Value_ - Value to be set as default value. Accepts expressions containing strings, numbers and mathematical operators.

* Slider
  * _Step_ - Increments for the slider
  * _Min_ - Minimum value for slider range
  * _Value_ - Numerical value to be set as default value
  * _Max_ - Maximum value for slider range

* Checkbox
  * _Checkbox_ - Boolean value of true or false; value alternates between the two when the clicked

* URL
  * _URL_ - Enter URL address to load file from

* File
  * _File_ - Upload file from computer

* Add Model
  * _Add Model_ - Add a model from a file (from URL address or computer) and import the data. This adds an existing model from a file to the flowchart from the start, which appears in the subsequent nodes. This is unlike using _URL_ or _File_, where the model is only added after the function util.importData is used.

To _add_ a parameter, select the desired type from the left. A name has to be given in the corresponding input box in order for the variable to be referenced later. 

The values assigned to the parameters in this tab are the default values that will be loaded to the dashboard upon loading of the flowchart. In order to modify the argument without changing the default value, adjust the values in the dashboard instead.
