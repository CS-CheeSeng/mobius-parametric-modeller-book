# Chapter 1: Möbius Interface

The workflow for parametric design often involves the use of flowcharts, which are graphic representations of the algorithmic process that is applied to the input information to produce a corresponding result. 

## User Interface Layout

Möbius Modeller consists of three viewports.
Generally, user interacts and gives commands in the left viewport while the right viewport visualises and returns model information.

Each viewport is bounded by a resizable bar. A break down of each viewport is elaborated in this chapter.
