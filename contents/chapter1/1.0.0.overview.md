# Chapter 1: Möbius Interface

The workflow in Möbius Modeller uses flowcharts for structuring and organising your code. These flowcharts are graphic representations of the algorithmic process. The 3D model flows through the flowchart, being modified on the way by the various nodes.

## User Interface Layout

Möbius Modeller consists of two viewports.
Generally, user interacts and gives commands in the left viewport while the right viewport visualises and returns model information.

Each viewport is bounded by a resizable bar. A break down of each viewport is elaborated in this chapter.
