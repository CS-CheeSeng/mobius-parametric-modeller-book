# 'Start' Node

The _source node_ of a flowchart is the first node and is highest in the hierarchy of the flowchart, as it contains explicit values instead of being graph-dependent; in MÃ¶bius Parametric Modeller, this is the 'Start' node.

In the 'Start' node, inputs of known variables may be added as "global variables"; this input information may then be used downstream by successive nodes connected from this.

## Naming

The flowchart name and description may be assigned or modified via the input boxes in the 'Start' node. 

## Global variables

Global variables are parameters that are known or determined by the user, which may then be referenced throughout the flowchart. 

There are a few types of global variables:
* Simple input
* Slider
* Checkbox

To _add_ a global variable, click on 'Global Var' on the left, then select the desired type from the dropdown list next to 'Input Mode'.
