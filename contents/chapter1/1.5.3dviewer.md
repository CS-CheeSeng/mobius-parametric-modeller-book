# 3D Viewer

The _end node_ of a flowchart is the last node and is lowest in the hierarchy of the flowchart. It processes all the nodes preceding it to display the results of the computation. In MÃ¶bius Parametric Modeller, the result of the "End" node is the visualisation of the graph as a 3D model in the viewer.

## Navigation

Within the 3D Viewer,
* To _rotate_, hold left-click and drag
* To _pan_, hold right-click and drag
* To _zoom_, scroll using the mouse wheel
* To _zoom extents_ the model, click on the icon at the top right corner as indicated below

## Visibility of geometry and mathematical constructs

There exists two broad types of elements in the model: geometry, which comprise real objects and visible; and mathematical constructs, which are not objects and are by default invisible unless specified. 

* __Geometry__
  * Position
  * Point
  * Polyline
  * Polygon
  * Vertex
  * Edge
  * Wire
  * Face
  * Collection

* __Mathematical constructs__
  * Vectors
  * Planes
