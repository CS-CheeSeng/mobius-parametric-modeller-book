# Dashboard

The dashboard displays the parameters that were previously defined in the 'Start' node. 

The values to be supplied for these parameters when executing the flowchart may be modified here, which would correspondingly alter the value of these arguments when used in subsequent nodes. The values in the 'Start' node are the default values that will be automatically loaded into the dashboard; changing the values in the dashboard then modifies the values provided for each instance that is run.

The dashboard may be accessed via the icon indicated below.
