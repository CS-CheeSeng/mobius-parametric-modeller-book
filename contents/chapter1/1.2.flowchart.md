# Flowchart

One system used in parametric design is the _propagation-based system_ (Aish and Woodbury, 2005), which is visualised through graphs. Graphs contain nodes connected by links—which may be given a direction and visualised by an arrow—to form a flowchart. Such a system orders the information that is known at the beginning of the flowchart, and proceeds along the links to compute the unknowns or to solve a given constraint.

## Nodes

_Nodes_ are containers of code that carry instructions on how to process the information passing through it. 

The number of nodes in each flowchart varies depending on the complexity of the procedure. In general, the parametric design process is broken down into stages, with each stage being contained within a node.

While in the 'Flowchart' tab, 
* To _create_ a new node, double-click anywhere in the canvas. 
* To _rename_ a node, click on a node once to select it; click on it again to edit the name; click outside the node to commit the changes.
* To _edit_ the contents of a node, double-click on the node, which switches automatically to the 'Procedure' tab to allow modification to the code.
* To _reorganise_ the placement of nodes in the flowchart for better visualisation, click and hold while dragging to arrange.
* To _delete_ a node, click on a node once to select it, then hit 'del' to delete it.

## Links

_Links_ are connections between nodes, and in a propagation-based system, they are represented by arrows in the flowchart. For information to pass from one node to another, they have to be connected by a link in the corresponding direction. 

While in the 'Flowchart' tab,
* To _connect_ one node to another, drag from the dot below the first node to the dot above the second node to connect them. The arrow signifies the direction that information is being passed.
* To _disconnect_ nodes, click on the link once to select it, then hit 'del' to delete it.

## Create New/Save/Load Flowchart

To _create_, _save_ or _load_ a flowchart, click on the name of the flowchart to display a dropdown enumeration, then select the corresponding option.

## Execution

Execution of the flowchart means that the information inputted in the start node is passed through the internal nodes, with each node carrying out along the way the instructions that it contains; this processes the information from the start of the flowchart to the end. 

To _execute_ the flowchart, click on the 'play' icon as indicated in the image below.
