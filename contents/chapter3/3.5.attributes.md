# Attributes

Attributes are properties that are attached to derived geometry. These properties may be viewed in the Attribute Table and/or parsed to produce a result in the 3D Viewer. In order to obtain the id of the objects, so as to assign attributes to them, use the attrib.Query function.

## Default Attributes

There are default attributes that are generated when certain objects are created. Specifically, when positions are created, the coordinates of each position are automatically displayed as attributes in the Attribute Table. 

## User-defined Attributes

To _create_ or _set_ an attribute, use the attrib.Set function. If there is no existing data for that attribute for the specified entities, a value will be populated; otherwise, the existing value will be modified accordingly.
