# Mathematical Structures

Mathematical structures are not objects, but are defined by mathematical functions to describe a set of properties.

## Position

A _position_ is a location in Cartesian space that is defined by a list of three numbers (or x-, y- and z-coordinates respectively). 

While a position is not an object, it is the primary unit by which all other geometries are defined. In order to make a point, polyline or polygon, a position(s) has to be created first, before being referenced subsequently. 

## Vector

A _vector_ is a mathematical structure with a specified magnitude and direction. It is defined as a list of three numbers or coordinates.

Vectors are not considered objects and do not have a fixed location attached to them. As such, they are not displayed in the 3D viewer. In order to visualise a vector from a specified origin location, use the make.vectorVisible function, which draws an imaginary line, with length equal to the magnitude of the vector, from the given location.

## Plane

A _plane_ is a two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely. It is defined by a position and two vectors.

Planes are not considered objects or real geometry. As such, they are not displayed in the 3D viewer. In order to visualise a plane, use the make.planeVisible function, which draws an imaginary rectangle to represent the plane on which it lies.
