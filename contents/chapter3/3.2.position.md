# Position

A _position_ is a location in Cartesian space that is defined by a list of three numbers (or x-, y- and z-coordinates respectively). 

While a position is not an object, it is the primary unit by which all other geometries are defined. In order to make a point, polyline or polygon, a position(s) has to be created first, before being referenced subsequently.
