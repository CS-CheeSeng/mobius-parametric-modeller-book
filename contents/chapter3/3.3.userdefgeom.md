# User-defined Geometry

User-defined geometry is created by explicitly specifying a position or list of positions. 

## Point

A _point_ is a zero-dimensional object defined at a location as specified by a single position. It is represented in the 3D viewer as a sphere of negligible dimensions.

## Polyline

A _polyline_ is an object defined by a list of at least two positions. The polyline is drawn sequentially based on the order of the positions within the list. 

## Polygon

A _polygon_ is an object defined by a list of at least three positions, comprising a closed wire and a face. The polygon is drawn sequentially based on the order of the positions within the list. 

## Collection

A _collection_ is a list containing any of the above objects; the objects in the list may be of differing types.
