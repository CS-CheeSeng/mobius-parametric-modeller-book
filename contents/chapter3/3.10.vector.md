# Vector

A _vector_ is a mathematical ??? with a specified magnitude and direction. It is defined as a list of three numbers or coordinates.

Vectors are not considered objects and do not have a fixed location attached to them. As such, they are not displayed in the 3D viewer; in order to visualise a vector from a specified origin location, use the make.vectorVisible function.
