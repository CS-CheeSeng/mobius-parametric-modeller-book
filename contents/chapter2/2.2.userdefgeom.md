# User-defined Geometry

User-defined geometry is created by explicitly specifying a position or list of positions. 

__**Position**__

A _position_ is an entity that is created at a location in space; while it is not an object, it is the primary unit by which all other geometries are defined. In order to make a point, polyline or polygon, a position(s) has to be created first, before being referenced subsequently. 

__**Point**__

A _point_ is a zero-dimensional object defined at a location as specified by a single position. It is represented in the 3D viewer as a sphere of negligible dimensions.

__**Polyline**__

A _polyline_ is an object defined by a list of at least two positions. The polyline is drawn sequentially based on the order of the positions within the list. 

__**Polygon**__

A _polygon_ is an object defined by a list of at least three positions, comprising a closed wire and a face. The polygon is drawn sequentially based on the order of the positions within the list. 

__**Collection**__

A _collection_ is a list containing any of the above objects; the objects in the list may be of differing types.
