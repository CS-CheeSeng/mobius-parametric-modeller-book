# Chapter 2: Basics

This chapter discusses what the basic elements of a node are, as well as flow of control. 

## Hierarchy

Even before discussing what these elements are, it is important to establish that there is a given hierarchy for the flowchart. The concept of _dependency_ is that in order for specific information or variables to be used downstream, they have to be defined beforehand. When one node is linked to the next, the latter has a dependency on the former if it uses the information that is being passed from the former to the latter. 

Similarly, within a node, the order of functions in the procedure is important. A variable has to be defined first before another line below can reference its value or expression by using its name.
