# Elements

The definitions of the elements that may be found under the 'Procedure' tab are listed below.

## Values

A _value_ is a piece of data that may be used in subsequent computations.

## Variables

A _variable_ is a container that holds value(s) and is given a name. 

## Expressions

An _expression_ is a combination of values, variables and operators. An expression supports dependency; using the name given to a variable in subsequent variables would refer to the value that it contains.

## Statements

A _statement_ is a code or instruction that may be executed. _Assignment statements_ are statements that defines a variable with a value or an expression; successive assignment statements for the same variable results in the second statement overriding the first. 

## Control Statements

A _control statement_ is one that changes the flow of control, either by creating a condition for selection or for repetition.

## Functions

A _function_ is a named block of statements that has inputs and outputs. The code within the function acts on the inputs to compute the return values. 

## Lists

A _list_ is a container of multiple variables or lists arranged in a given sequence; specifying the index of a list returns a variable or list depending on what is contained.
