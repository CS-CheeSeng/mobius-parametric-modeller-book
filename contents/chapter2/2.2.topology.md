# Topology

![Overview](./imgs/topology.PNG)

Topology is obtained from existing user-defined geometry or other topologies. Attributes may be attached to these topologies, which may be viewed in the Attribute Table. 

__**Vertex**__

A _vertex_ is a location in space, and can be connected to zero, one, or two edges. 

__**Edge**__

An _edge_ is a line segment joining two vertices in a polyline or polygon.

__**Wire**__

A _wire_ is a multi-segmented line defining a polyline or bounding the surface of a polygon. 

__**Face**__

A _face_ is a surface bounded by a wire.

## Hierarchy

All user-defined objects can be further broken down into topological components, which are connected in a hierarchy.
