# Example 3

In Example 3, we are going to extrude boxes with scaled ends for each rectangular polyline in the imported geometry (exported from Example 2), then rotate the whole model.

## Overview

The generation of the end result may be broken down into a series of smaller steps.

![Flowchart](./imgs/6.4.0-example3-flowchart.gif)

* *Start Node:* Input parameters
* *Creation of function from flowchart*: Flowchart to extrude boxes with ends scaled; can be imported as user-defined function
* *Node 1:* Import geometry from external file (Example 2)), then extrude boxes with ends scaled
* *Node 2:* Rotate the geometry from horizontal to vertical
