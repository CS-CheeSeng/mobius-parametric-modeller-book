# Example 1

In Example 1, we are going to create a grid of rectangles that are displaced vertically based on their positions in the grid.

## Overview

The generation of the end result may be broken down into a series of smaller steps.

![Flowchart](./imgs/6.2.0-example1-flowchart.gif)

* *Start Node:* Input parameters
* *Node 1:* Create grid of rectangles
* *Node 2a:* Displace each rectangle in z-direction by x- or y- coordinate
* *Node 2b:* Displace each rectangle in z-direction by sine or cosine wave function
* *Node 2c:* Displace each rectangle in z-direction by both x/y-coordinates and sin/cos wave
