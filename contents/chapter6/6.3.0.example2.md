# Example 2

In Example 2, we are going to parameterise the wave function for the displacement of the rectangles that we created in Example 1. 

*(It is recommended to refer to Example 1 prior, if you find the first section confusing.)*

## Overview

The generation of the end result may be broken down into a series of smaller steps.

![Flowchart](./imgs/6.3.0-example2-flowchart.gif)

* *Start Node:* Input parameters
* *Node 1:* Create grid of positions (from Example 1)
* *Node 2:* For each position, create a closed rectangular polyline around it (from Example 1)
* *Creation of function from flowchart*: Flowchart to return displaced sin/cos wave; can be imported as user-defined function
* *Node 3a:* Displace each rectangle in z-direction by sine or cosine wave function (using imported function)
* *Node 3b:* Displace each rectangle in z-direction by sin + cos wave (using imported function)
