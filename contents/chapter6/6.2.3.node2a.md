# Node 2a

In this node, we want to move each rectangle upwards depending on its position in the grid.

*(1) Move by x-coordinate (2) Move by y-coordinate (3) Move by x- and y-coordinate*

To do so, we created the following procedure:

![Procedure](./imgs/6.2.4-node3a-procedure.png)

## query.Get

In order to use the rectangular polylines that we created previously, we need to run a query to get their ids. 

## Displacement

The modify.Move function moves the geometry by a vector (i.e. [x, y, z]). Since we are moving the rectangles upwards, the value of x and y will be kept as 0. 

* `i@midpt_xyz[0]` returns the x-coordinate of the midpoint of the rectangle
* `i@midpt_xyz[1]` returns the y-coordinate of the midpoint of the rectangle. 

By placing the move function in a for-each loop, the following steps are repeated:

1. Find out how far away the rectangle is from the origin (in x- or y- or both directions)
2. The further away the rectangle it, the greater the displacement

In this flowchart, we have divided the displacement value by 5 for better visualisation of the pattern; otherwise, the rectangles are too far apart for the pattern to be distinct. This factor (divide by 5) acts to scale the displacement by one-fifth of the original. 

Some lines have been disabled in the procedure above. Disabling a line means that it will not be run when the flowchart is executed. Above are three move functions with different distances; to toggle between them, disable one and enable another. 

## Reason for moving the grid

In Node 1, we moved the grid so that the x- and y- coordinates are always positive. This is not crucial or necessary, but it makes the numbers easier to manipulate as we do not have to deal with negative numbers (e.g. range will be 0 to 10 instead of -5 to 5).
