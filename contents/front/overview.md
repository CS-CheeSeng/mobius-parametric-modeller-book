## About the Book

The remainder of this book will give an overview of the various features of Möbius Modeller. Chapter 1 introduces the user interface. Chapter 2 covers that 3D data model that has been developed for Möbius Modeller. Chapter 3, 4, and 5 give an overview of the three main components involved in writing computational procedures in Möbius Modeller: basic components, function components, and inline components. Chapter 6 gives an overview of some example models.
