# Chapter 5: Inline Expressions

This chapter discusses the inline expressions in procedures. 

Inline expressions are snippets of code that can be inserted into the input boxes in a procedure. To insert an inline expression, the user may click on the expression in the left sidebar to insert it in the selected argument. Alternatively, if the user is familiar with the expressions, they can also simply be typed in.
