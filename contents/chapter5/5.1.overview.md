# Chapter 5: Inline

This chapter discusses the inline expressions in the modeller. Inline expressions are expressions that are read not as strings, but as references. To insert an inline expression, the user may click on the expression in the left sidebar to insert it in the selected argument. Alternatively, if the user is familiar with the expressions, typing them in would automatically use them.
